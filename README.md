## 📜 **Project Description**

**Platypus of Corner** is a short 3D platformer developed in **Unity** during a **48-hour Game Jam** by a team of 7 students from **Ynov Lyon**.
The theme of the jam was **“Onirique” (Dreamlike)**. You play as a mysterious creature trapped in a surreal, floating world, racing against time to recover fragments of a shattered dream.
You have **3 minutes** to explore, solve puzzles, complete platforming challenges, and retrieve **3 dream fragments** hidden across different levels.
Time is limited — and if it runs out, the dream fades.

## 🧩 **Main Features**

1. **3D Platforming Gameplay**

   * Navigate dreamlike environments using **ZQSD** movement and **free camera control** via arrow keys.
   * Each level presents a unique gameplay mechanic or puzzle to master.

2. **Interactive Puzzles**

   * Solve small environmental puzzles and exploration-based tasks.
   * Interact with the world using the **E** key.

3. **Time-Limited Exploration**

   * The player has **3 minutes** to collect all 3 dream fragments.
   * If time runs out, the dream — and your progress — vanishes.

4. **Team Game Jam Project**

   * Designed, built, and polished in **under 48 hours**.
   * Original 3D assets, level design, and gameplay systems made from scratch.
